##I was wrong about everything bsd related

I was wrong, about **bsd**.

Yesterday i tried **bsd** on my main machine and it was a massive _failure_ :(

It was way diffrent from any **gnu** based distroh or even any distroh for that matter

It was pain and i am never doing it again on my main _machine_

It broke my _ssd_ i spent the last night until 5 am fixing it and i woke up at 9 am to fix it yet again

my fix was to install windows and format everything to ntfs then remove everything and install [Pop os!](https://pop.system76.com/)

in the last 24h i installed **archlinux** 5 times it absolutly did not work }(

And also during the instalation of Pop os! it failed 4 times even tho it failed the 4th time i rebooted the machine expecting no os

But to my surprise Pop os! worked idk how but it did and here we are back to our workflow

Even tho i use **dwm** for the longest time my second distroh that i ever used is Pop os! and it is scond after archlinux in term of how much time i used it for

This is not me distroh hopping this is me just using my pc even tho i tried _Freebsd_ it still does not count as it because bsd is not a distroh it is an os ;p
