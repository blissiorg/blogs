##Youtube is bad !

### date 2022-04-04

  

This last month i have not posted any video on my youtube channel even tho my video of making a website blew to 21 views wich is very suprising i wasent more encouraged to post more videos but why?

Youtube is very restrictive and is no longer a YOU tube it is a celebrity/corporation tube. wich is very far apart from a comunity driven video hosting site and i aint making video for someone to use it to harm other people

I will still post videos there but i will be posting more on odysee to favour it and the only reason i am still putting my videos on youtube is to attract more people to the world of Free Software, and that is it.
