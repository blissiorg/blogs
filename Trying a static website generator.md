##Trying a static website generator

## date 2022-02-09

  

This site is not maintained by a static website generator.

I full made every single bit of **html and css** no _js_ here.

but today i tried [zola](https://www.getzola.org/) a simple lighwieght static website generator

but i didnt like its complexity because it make editing websites easy you dont have to go in every file and change them like i do it does that automaticly wich is nice

but i hated the file been so far away (in seperate directories) and i dont think it will play nice with github pages because at the time of me writing this i don't have a _domain name_ :'(

I will give zola a chance an other day because it is soo frustraiting changing something simple in every file and most of the time i forget about something and it stays broken =(
