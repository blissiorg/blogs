##Is it time to move onto FreeBSD ?

_This is getting out of hand_ says linus torvalds

But wwhat does this mean ? It means that the development of the linux kernel is being **distrupted**

But by who ? The right anwser is _cucks and normies_, they are the ones who held linux with their sausage shaped fingers

and took it as their **goal** to distroy everything like they did to twitter or reddit or even youtube (but to be honest youtube was a mess from the start)

same thing for _soystemd_ it wants to remove the linux kernel and impliment its own called linuxd

but for poor **gnu** basicly everyone forgot about it no one says **GNU** anymore they just say _lincucks_ (linux :p)

It became a sad tale for the people who used this os before this plague

But why **FreeBSD** ? well bsd is a full os unlike gnu wich are utilities and linux wich is a kernel and systemd wich is an init system and many other stuff

Which means that bsd is fully maintained but one big group who share the _same_ philosophy

but why **FreeBSD** (again ;p) ?

Well because it was made to be more of a desktop os donâ€™t get me wrong it works better on servers but it has support for desktop unlike other bsd based oss

So am i _sold_ to the bsd ecosystem ?

**Not yet** i still like gnu and linux maybe not _soystemd_ but i use them for now and as alwase _if it aint broke dont fix it just rice it ;D_
